Prototype for new logging infrastructure.

on log/run file:

  exec svlogd /srv/barn/logs/<SERVICE_NAME>

  where log/config file contains rotation/retention [1] policy.

/srv/barn/logs/FQDN/
               |_ nginx
               |_ soundcloud_worker
               |- soundcloud_app
               |_ haproxy

An inotify callback waits on /srv/barn/logs recursively (which is equal to
listening on all subdirs). On callback it calls rsync on /srv/barn/logs/.
