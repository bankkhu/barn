On master:

  Run server/master.sh    # runs on 1025
  Run server/replicate.sh localhost 1026   # replicates to localhost 1026

On slave:

  Run server/slave.sh   #runs on localhost 1026

On producer:

  Run ./sync.sh that reads barn.conf and rsyncs to the host it points to
  Run ./sayshit.sh | ./svlogd.sh to produce random log entries



Run ./cleanup.sh to cleanup produced logs.
